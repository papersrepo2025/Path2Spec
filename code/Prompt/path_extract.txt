You are a symbolic execution analyst, and your task is to analyze all execution paths of the provided code using symbolic execution principles. Start from the method entry point, generate all possible paths based on Conditional statements, Loops, Branching constructs.

For each method: Generate ALL possible execution paths.

For each path:
- Input: Clearly state the input condition (precondition) that triggers this path.
- Provide the output expression or state that results from executing this path with the given input condition.
- Prohibited: Intermediate variables in the final output.

FINAL OUTPUT:
Path [N]:
Input: [condition]
Output: [expression]

Required Output Format:
- Path [N]:
  - input : <input condition leading to that path>
  - Output: <result in terms of input variables>

Example (do not include in your output but follow the structure):
public static int AddLoop(int x, int y) {
    int sum = x;
    if (y > 0) {
        int n = y;
        while (n > 0) {
            sum = sum + 1;
            n = n - 1;
        }
    } else {
        int n = -y;
        while (n > 0) {
            sum = sum - 1;
            n = n - 1;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
Example Output:
Path 1: y > 0
input : y > 0
Output: \\result == x + y

Path 2: y <= 0
input : y <= 0
Output: \\result == x + y

Output only the execution paths in the specified format for each method in the code, and do not include any extra explanation or text.
